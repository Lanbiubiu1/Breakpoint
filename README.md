Breakpoint is a project created by Daniel Gerhardt, Dineth Meegoda, Matt Schwartz, and Zixiao Wang. The goal is to create realistic, real-time destruction of soft body meshes using fluid. The fluid simulation uses PBMPM, a novel modification of MPM created by SEED, EA's research division, in 2024. The fluid is to be rendered with mesh shading using another 2024 research paper so as to make the simulation work in real time. Additionally, the Mesh Mortal Kombat paper is used for the voxelization and destruction of soft bodies.
